        <p>As a child, I watched my grandparents and my parents struggle to make ends meet. They worked hard every day, sometimes at jobs, they did not like just to save. After a few years, they had saved enough to buy their own home. Over time they were able to sell that house to start my mom's business. She has since then bought our home and has purchased my grandparents a new home. All through hard work; they were able to create generational wealth to help better us for the future.</p>
